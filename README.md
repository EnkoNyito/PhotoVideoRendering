Since **Sweet Home 3D 7.0**, this plug-in adds the *Photo-video rendering* menu with advanced options.

It includes the following actions:
- Create photo (advanced settings, enable sky lighting, progress bar, estimated time remaining)
- Create photos at points of view (memorize the selected points of view, display the point of view being rendered)
- Create video (select speed and frame rate)
